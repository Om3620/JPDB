# JPDB
This project is a web-based CRUD application designed to manage and track product shipments, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON Power DB (JPDB). It allows users to add new shipment records, view and search shipment data, update shipment details (like shipping status or delivery date), and delete records when necessary.
